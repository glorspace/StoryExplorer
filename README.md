# StoryExplorer
A game and authoring tool in one, where a narrative is projected onto a logical 2D space.

This is a C# .NET code project that is envisioned as a way to interact with a story by moving between "scenes" arranged as a grid. Each scene consists of a paragraph of text that generally describes a location that the user imagines. When in "author mode" the user can compose additional scenes as s/he moves in the 4 cardinal directions, while in "explorer mode" authoring is turned off and the scenes are experienced simply as an existing narrative.

Initially there will be a console version of the application, with a later WPF client planned to make editing of existing text more friendly.
